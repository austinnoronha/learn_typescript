/*
Type annotations

Type annotations in TypeScript are lightweight ways to record the intended contract of the function or variable. In this case, we intend the greeter function to be called with a single string parameter.

function greeter(person) {
    return "Hello, " + person;
}
var user = "Jane User";
document.body.innerHTML = greeter(user);
